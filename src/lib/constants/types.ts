    question: "How do agents work?",
    answer:
      "Agents are automated monitors that track specific subreddits for keywords and phrases you define. Each agent can monitor multiple subreddits and track multiple keywords. When a match is found, the agent analyzes the content for relevance to your business and notifies you based on your notification settings.",

    question: "Is Skroub compliant with Reddit's terms of service?",

  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "How accurate is the sentiment analysis?",

    question: "Can I export the data for use in other tools?",

    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "How far back does the historical data go?",
    answer:
      "Free plans provide data from the past 30 days. Pro plans extend to 6 months, and Premium plans offer up to 2 years of historical data, subject to Reddit's API limitations.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "How do I upgrade my subscription?",

  {
    id: "8",
    question: "What's the difference between the subscription tiers?",
    answer:
      "Free tier includes basic monitoring with 1 agent and 3 monitoring requests per day. Pro tier ($14.99/month) includes 3 agents, 10 requests per day, and additional features like data export and advanced analytics. Premium tier ($49.99/month) includes unlimited agents, unlimited requests, and all premium features.",

  {
    id: "9",
    question: "How do I create a new agent?",
